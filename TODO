PNG slices. -- maybe not, just call h5topng

Cylindrical coordinates (for waveguide bend problems):
        support non-integer m if cell doesn't include r=0
        support 3d (r,phi,z) cell, where m is "Bloch waveinteger"
                -- gives 6-fold (and n-fold) symmetry as side effect
                -- allows computation of bended photonic-crystal waveguides

HDF5 output:
        should support energy density and Poynting vector.
		-- add new component types to support these in
		   get_field, etc. ... HDF5 then follows automatically
        support periodic boundaries, outputting supercell
        give simple way to output "whole" cell, centered on v.center

Fix bug: divergence in saturated polarization (tests/symmetry.cpp)

User-specified anisotropic dielectric constant.

Support mu?  (i.e. magnetic permeability) (including anisotropic, for Pendry)

Support coordinate origin at center, or arbitrary location?

Generic DFT volumes (& component sets)

Flux planes and DFTs thereof.

Field dump/load (i.e. restarting)?

Make sure epsilon and other material properties respect symmetry,
periodic boundaries, etc.?

Clean up monitor point class (redundant with HDF5 output, DFT volumes?).

Reference manual.  Fix crude-looking documentation graphs?

libctl front-end:
	Finish.
	Integrate MPB mode solver.
