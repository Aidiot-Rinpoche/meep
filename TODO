PNG slices.

HDF5 output should support epsilon, energy density, and Poynting vector.

Fix bug: divergence in saturated polarization (tests/symmetry.cpp)

User-specified anisotropic dielectric constant.

Support mu?  (i.e. magnetic permeability)

Support coordinate origin at center, or arbitrary location?

Generic DFT volumes (& component sets)

Flux planes and DFTs thereof.

Field dump/load (i.e. restarting)?

Make sure epsilon and other material properties respect symmetry,
periodic boundaries, etc.?

Clean up monitor point class (redundant with HDF5 output, DFT volumes?).

Reference manual.  Fix crude-looking documentation graphs?

libctl front-end:
	Finish.
	Integrate MPB mode solver.
