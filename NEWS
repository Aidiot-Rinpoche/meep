Meep 1.0 (28 April 2009)

  * New timestepping scheme for off-diagonal anisotropic epsilon and
    mu, based on technique by Werner and Cary [ J. Comp. Phys. 226,
    1085 (2007) ], that improves FDTD stability when anisotropy is
    present (such as when subpixel averaging is used on isotropic media).

  * Scheme user interface now supports user-specified anisotropic
    (real-symmetric) epsilon and mu (via epsilon-diag, epsilon-offdiag,
    mu-diag, and mu-offdiag parameters, similar to MPB).  Accurate
    subpixel averaging of anisotropic media based on the method by
    Kottke, Farjadpour, & Johnson [ Phys. Rev. E. 77, 036611 (2008) ].

  * New fields::integrate2 function (and corresponding Scheme function
    integrate2-field-function) to perform integrations involving two
    simulations with the same computational cell (e.g. field-overlap
    calculations for coupled-mode theory).

  * In the Scheme interface, subpixel averaging is not used for
    user-specified material-function types; you only get subpixel
    averaging for the standard shapes (blocks, cylinders, etcetera).

  * Haskell code-generation is no longer used, and hsrc directory is removed.

Meep 0.20.4 (17 March 2009)

  * Bug fix in cylindrical code, which caused it to blow up
    in some circumstances for nonzero m.

  * Bug fix: non-integrated sources with conductivity are now
    second-order accurate, thanks to Alejandro Rodriguez.

  * Bug fix in writing strings with parallel HDF5, thanks to Zheng Li
    for the bug report.

  * Check that PML parameters are sensible (e.g. that total PML thickness
    is no greater than cell thickness) to avoid common mistakes.

  * New extra-materials input variable, so that you no longer
    have to use "dummy objects" to specify the existence of
    some materials when using material-function types.

Meep 0.20.3 (24 July 2008)

  * Fixed circular dependency in Makefile, which caused problems with some
    versions of make; thanks to Kaoru Narita for the bug report.

Meep 0.20.2 (21 July 2008)

  * Fixed incompatibility with Guile 1.6.x or earlier; thanks to the bug
    report by Andreas Unger.

Meep 0.20.1 (20 July 2008)

  * Improved handling of nested synchronized-magnetic calls.

  * Bug fix: parallel builds (make -j) should now work.

  * Bug fix: pkg-config file was incorrectly installed for MPI version;
    thanks to Majid Sodagar for the bug report.

Meep 0.20 (19 July 2008)

  * Support for user-specified permeability (mu).  Renamed "dielectric"
    to "medium" in libctl interface, new "mu" property and new
    output-bfield and output-mu functions, and new "Permeability" and "Bx"
    etc. field types.

  * Support for user-specified electric and/or magnetic conductivities.
    These are especially useful to add a desired dissipation loss
    (an imaginary part of epsilon/mu) in a narrow bandwidth, without
    messing around with Lorentzian dispersive materials.

  * Add predefined perfect-magnetic-conductor (mu = -infinity) material,
    along with perfect-electric-conductor (eps = -infinity).

  * Added synchronized-magnetic step function to allow step functions
    to run with the electric and magnetic fields synchronized in time
    to second-order accuracy.

  * New PML implementation (UPML instead of split-field), should
    have lower reflection in many cases.

  * User-specified PML profile and asymptotic reflection.

  * Internally, all timestepping code is now handwritten (and much shorter)
    rather than old verbose Haskell-generated code; this should make
    it easier to add new features.

  * Add support for non-integrated current sources, if the is-integrated?
    property of the current is set to false; this is now the default,
    to make handling of E and H sources more similar and intuitive.

  * Work with HDF5 1.8 (which previously would not compile unless you
    manually set a preprocessor flag, due to API changes).

  * Check for ctl.h in /usr/include/ctl/ctl.h (default in Fedora),
    and check for libctl in /usr/share/libctl3 (default in Debian & Ubuntu).

  * Bug fix: fixed relative phase of E and H sources (which were off
    from one another by half a timestep); thanks to M. Megens for bug report.

  * Bug fix: make sure h5 filenames have unique timestep for cases where
    dt is very small or very large.

Meep 0.10.1 (13 Nov. 2007)

  * Bug fix in flux_in_box, which accidentally returned the flux
    multiplied by the number of processors, instead of the flux.

  * Bug fix in epsilon averaging for structures including metals
    (epsilon < 0), fixing an instability.

  * Bug fix in output-png when running in parallel (removing race condition).

  * Fixed bug that disabled subpixel averaging for dimensions=1 (thanks
    to Mischa Megens for the bug report).

  * Fixed bug that caused output-tot-pwr to stop Meep with an error message;
    thanks to Vyacheslav Sokolov for the bug report.

  * Make "at-every" step functions less susceptible to rounding errors;
    thanks to L. Le Guyader for the bug report.

  * Fixed bug in dispersive media that wasted memory on parallel machines
    (the polarization memory was not parallelized); thanks to J. L. Silva
    for the bug report.

  * Bug fix in output-png+h5, thanks to a report by Chad Husko.

  * Fixed several deadlocks that could occur when the parallel Meep
    is used with a serial HDF5 library (we continue to recommend
    using the parallel HDF5 library with parallel Meep, however).
    Thanks in part to Lingling Tang for his bug report.

  * For maintainer-mode, improved detection of Haskell package names;
    thanks to Liang Huo for the bug report.

Meep 0.10 (21 Aug. 2006)

  * eps-averaging? is now turned on by default (in libctl interface),
    using much-improved algorithm by Ardavan Farjadpour.  This greatly
    improves accuracy, and also allows continuous tuning of geometric
    parameters.  (See our upcoming paper in Optics Lett., with a preprint
    linked on the web site.)  New input variables subpixel-tol and
    subpixel-maxeval to control the accuracy of the subpixel averaging.

  * Support for chi2 (Pockels) as well as chi3 (Kerr) nonlinearities.

  * Symmetries no longer require the cell size to be an even number of
    pixels.  Previously, Meep exited with an error in this case, whereas
    now it simply adds an extra pixel to the cell size as needed.

  * New with-prefix step function to allow you to use a different
    filename-prefix for selected outputs.

  * New feature for output-png: built-in shell variable $EPS that refers
    to the last-output epsilon .h5 file, which you can use to easily
    add dielectric contours/overlays to the field output image.

  * Added output-png+h5 function that outputs both .png and .h5 files.

  * New functions flux-in-box, electric-energy-in-box, magnetic-energy-in-box,
    and field-energy-in-box (convenience wrappers around C++ functions).

  * Bug fix in Kerr nonlinearity - chi3 was accidentally scaled by epsilon^4
    factor.

  * Bug fix: if you specified three or more symmetries, at most two
    symmetries were used (ignoring the rest).

  * Bug fix in rotate2 symmetry, which wasn't working correctly.

  * Bug fix in add-flux for multiple flux regions, thanks to K. Choi.

  * Bug fix in harminv where it wouldn't allow you to call harminv more
    than once for the same run loop; thanks to Aristos Karalis.

  * Bug fix in save-flux/load-flux that prevented it from working properly
    without output directories, thanks to Karl Koch.

  * Fixed abort that sometimes occurred due to rounding when the source
    was the same width as the cell (thanks to G. J. Parker).

  * Fixed minor build problems on Cygwin, SGI, and other systems,
    thanks to Christopher Kang, Robyn Landers, Florencio Garcia, and others.

Meep 0.9 (1 Apr. 2006)

  * Initial public release.
